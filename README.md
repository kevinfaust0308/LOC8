# LOC8 (pronounced *locate*) :earth_americas:

## See where friends are at in real-time!
### Currently being redeveloped into a full functional app by myself :raised_hands:

#### Update December 10, 2016
- location permissions fully functional (generic permission class created)
- broadcast receiver listens to wifi state changes (**animated*)

#### Update December 9, 2016
- added quick menu (**animated**) to let you change your visibility, add new friends, and logout
- firebase data listeners now only listen to your friend's data rather than the data of all users
- code optimization reduced considerable glitches and lag
- fixed countless other things including location problems, map issues, etc.

#### Update November 13, 2016
- original version of app first created during Yale's 2016 hackathon
